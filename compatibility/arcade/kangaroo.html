<h1 class="description">Description</h1>
<form>
<textarea>Kangaroo is a 1982 arcade platformer video game developed by Sun Electronics and released by Atari in the USA on June 1, 1982.

There are four different levels. Three of them consist of the mother kangaroo on the bottom floor trying to reach the top floor where her joey is being held captive by some monkeys. On each of the levels monkeys throw apples and apple cores, which the mother kangaroo must either jump, duck, or punch. If she gets face to face with one of the monkeys, she can punch it with a boxing glove. There are also pieces of fruit that she can jump up and get for points; if she jumps and touches a bell, higher-value fruits will appear to replace the ones she has already collected. She must be wary of the big Ape, who will occasionally appear and try to take her gloves away from her. The level must be completed before the time runs out; otherwise, the player will lose a life.

Levels 1, 2 and 4 consist of different platforms that the mother kangaroo must jump onto or climb onto via a ladder. On the third level, the joey is in a cage held up by a troop of monkeys, and there is a horde of apples that will be unleashed if five monkeys climb up to it. On this level, the mother kangaroo must punch each monkey in the stack several times until the cage is lowered and, when the cage has been lowered enough, the mother kangaroo must climb to the next floor to get to the joey before the cage is raised again.

The game uses classical and folk songs, including "Turkish March" by Ludwig van Beethoven (at game start), "American Patrol" by F. W. Meacham (during regular gameplay), "Oh! Susanna" by Stephen Foster (level completion fanfare), and "Westminster Quarters" (when a bell is rung).</textarea>
